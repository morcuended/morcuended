Hey there!

I'm Daniel Morcuende, a PostDoct researcher at the [Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC)](https://www.iaa.csic.es/) in Granada, Spain.
My research focuses on studying the emission mechanisms from active galactic nuclei.
I also work on developing software data analysis and reconstruction libraries for gamma-ray data.

Find below an overview of the things I do on GitHub:
